# UNIT 5 live proofs — Jarvis Tauri local AI

Measured on 2026-09-20 KST in `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot` at HEAD `05c365e`; `origin/codex/jarvis-tauri-local-ai-20260920` also resolved to `05c365e` before the proof run. The worktree was clean before this proof file was created.

## 1. Hide-state render-call = 0

Source proof: `desktop/src/core/animation-loop.ts` routes every lifecycle state other than `visible` through `stop()`. `stop()` sets `running = false`, cancels the outstanding RAF id, and clears it. `desktop/src/__tests__/desktop.test.ts` covers `hidden`, `closed`, and `locked` plus duplicate-start prevention.

Exact test command:

```bash
cd /Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/desktop && npm test
```

Result: **PASS** — 1 test file, 10 tests passed, 0 failed.

For the second proof, the real `AnimationLoop` implementation was bundled to `/tmp` and executed under Node with a timer-backed `requestAnimationFrame`/`cancelAnimationFrame` polyfill. This is independent of the Vitest `FakeScheduler`.

Exact commands:

```bash
cd /Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/desktop
./node_modules/.bin/esbuild src/core/animation-loop.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=cjs --outfile=/tmp/unit5-animation-loop.cjs
node -e 'const {performance}=require("node:perf_hooks"); let nextId=1,cancelled=0; const pending=new Map(); globalThis.requestAnimationFrame=(cb)=>{const id=nextId++; const h=setTimeout(()=>{pending.delete(id);cb(performance.now())},16); pending.set(id,h); return id}; globalThis.cancelAnimationFrame=(id)=>{const h=pending.get(id); if(h!==undefined){clearTimeout(h);pending.delete(id);cancelled++}}; const {AnimationLoop}=require("/tmp/unit5-animation-loop.cjs"); const sleep=(ms)=>new Promise(r=>setTimeout(r,ms)); (async()=>{const out=[]; for(const state of ["hidden","closed","locked"]){cancelled=0; const loop=new AnimationLoop(()=>{}); loop.start(); await sleep(145); const before=loop.renderCount; const pendingBeforeStop=pending.size; loop.handleLifecycle(state); const pendingAfterStop=pending.size; await sleep(180); const after=loop.renderCount; out.push({state,renderCountBefore:before,renderCountAfter:after,deltaAfterStop:after-before,pendingBeforeStop,pendingAfterStop,cancelledRafCallbacks:cancelled,runningAfterStop:loop.isRunning()})} console.log(JSON.stringify(out,null,2))})().catch(e=>{console.error(e);process.exitCode=1})'
```

Measured result: **PASS**.

| Lifecycle state | renderCount before stop | renderCount after 180 ms | Added renders | RAF pending before | RAF pending after | Cancelled RAF callbacks | Running after stop |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| hidden | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | false |
| closed | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | false |
| locked | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | false |

The pass criterion is met: after hide/close/lock, further scheduler time added **0** render calls and the outstanding RAF callback was cancelled.

## 2. Voice and emergency abort

Read-only source inspection covered `scripts/jarvis_voice.py`, `scripts/jarvis_abort.py`, `desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, and `desktop/src-tauri/src/python_bridge.rs`.

Exact Unit 3 command:

```bash
cd /Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot
/Users/twoimo/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11 -m unittest tests.test_jarvis_unit3
```

Result: **PASS** — 6 tests passed, 0 failed. These cover abort during generation, abort during TTS, wake threshold/TTS echo rejection, latched global abort queue behavior, background AX abort behavior, and browser job cancellation.

Host dependency import probes used the requested UV Python 3.11:

```bash
/Users/twoimo/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11 -c 'import openwakeword; print("openwakeword: import PASS")'
/Users/twoimo/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11 -c 'import mlx_whisper; print("mlx_whisper: import PASS")'
/Users/twoimo/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11 -c 'import qwen_tts; print("qwen_tts: import PASS")'
```

Measured result: **all three unavailable in this host environment**.

- `openwakeword`: FAIL to import — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openwakeword'`
- `mlx_whisper`: FAIL to import — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlx_whisper'`
- `qwen_tts` (Qwen3-TTS adapter package): FAIL to import — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qwen_tts'`

Because the model packages are absent, the wake/STT/TTS flow was exercised with the existing fake adapters from `tests.test_jarvis_unit3` while using the real `JarvisVoicePipeline`, `WakePhraseGate`, and abort token.

Exact probe command:

```bash
cd /Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot
/Users/twoimo/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11 -c 'import sys; from pathlib import Path; from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory; sys.path.insert(0,"scripts"); from jarvis_abort import AbortController; from jarvis_voice import JarvisVoicePipeline, WAKE_PHRASE; from tests.test_jarvis_unit3 import FakeStt, FakeLlm, FakeTts; t=TemporaryDirectory(); c=AbortController(Path(t.name)); tts=FakeTts(); p=JarvisVoicePipeline(stt=FakeStt(), llm=FakeLlm(), tts=tts, token=c.token()); p.feed_audio(b"\x00\x00"*320, rms=0.1, speech=False, stock_wake_score=0.65); wake_state=p.state.value; r=p.process_utterance(b"\x01\x00"*320); print({"wake_phrase":WAKE_PHRASE,"wake_state":wake_state,"final_state":r.state.value,"transcript":r.transcript,"reply":r.reply,"tts_calls":tts.calls})'
```

Measured result: **PASS** — `wake_phrase='헤이 자비스'`, state after threshold acceptance `user_listen`, final state `ended`, fake STT transcript `테스트 요청`, fake reply `알겠습니다.`, fake TTS calls `1`.

Missing voice packages do not make the Tauri menubar snapshot path fail: the Python bridge reads the bounded `jarvis-voice-status.json` file and returns `SafeVoiceStatus::default()` when it is missing, invalid, or the schema is wrong. The model-specific imports are lazy inside the wake/STT/TTS runtime paths rather than imported by the Tauri menubar snapshot reader.

Emergency abort path: **present**. `desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs` registers `SUPER | ALT + Escape` (⌘⌥Esc) and calls `PythonBridge::global_abort()` on key press. `desktop/src-tauri/src/python_bridge.rs` writes a latched `jarvis-abort.json`; `scripts/jarvis_abort.py` provides the matching `AbortController`/`AbortToken` behavior. The live global hotkey was not pressed.

## 3. Cutover and guardrails

Signed-app cutover remains pending. The installed Swift Extra at `/Applications/AutoReplyMenu.app` was not replaced, restarted, or rewritten, so this proof does not claim installed signed-Tauri behavior.

Before writing this file, Extra PID `20042` was still running from `/Applications/AutoReplyMenu.app`. No process matching `27B` or `gemma` was observed. The existing allowed local `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-Serve-mixed-4-8bit` server remained running and was not swapped or reloaded.

No Kakao send or live AX send was performed. No git commit or push was performed. No command in this proof used `/Users/twoimo/.codex/worktrees/5a1c/openkakao-bot` as a working directory, and no file there was written.

## Live window hide

Measured on 2026-09-20 KST from `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot` at HEAD `c990ad78d92550c3177821d19b373b2f4da78497`. The desktop Vite page was served with the repository's existing `npm run dev` command on `127.0.0.1:1420`; `/Applications/AutoReplyMenu.app` was not launched or restarted.

`desktop/src/main.ts` now exposes the existing `JarvisCore.renderCount` as a tiny read-only browser debug getter, `window.__jarvisRenderCount`. A separate headless Chrome page was driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Before page navigation, browser `requestAnimationFrame`/`cancelAnimationFrame` were wrapped only to count outstanding native browser RAF callbacks; this proof did not use the earlier Node timer RAF polyfill.

The page was first forced to the visible lifecycle state and allowed to render for 550 ms, then `document.visibilityState`/`document.hidden` were set to `hidden`/`true` and a real `visibilitychange` event was dispatched. The browser was observed for another 650 ms.

Measured result: **PASS**.

| Measurement | renderCount | Pending browser RAF |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Visible before hide | 9 | 1 |
| Immediately after `visibilitychange` to hidden | 9 | 0 |
| Hidden after 650 ms | 9 | 0 |

Hide-state render delta: **0**. The outstanding browser RAF callback was cancelled immediately and remained at **0** while hidden.

## Isolated voice environment

Created a dedicated voice virtual environment at `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/.venv-voice` with `/Users/twoimo/.local/bin/python3.12` (Python 3.12.13). This is separate from Extra pid 20042's UV Python 3.11 interpreter.

Installed into that environment:

- `openwakeword==0.6.0`
- `mlx-whisper==0.4.3` (import name `mlx_whisper`)
- `qwen-tts==0.1.1` (import name `qwen_tts`)

The import and environment-gate probe used the dedicated interpreter with `OPENKAKAO_VOICE_ENV=1` and returned:

```text
interpreter=/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/.venv-voice/bin/python
OPENKAKAO_VOICE_ENV=1
openwakeword=0.6.0:PASS
mlx-whisper=0.4.3:PASS
qwen-tts=0.1.1:PASS
jarvis_voice_gate=PASS
stt_adapter_init=MlxWhisperAdapter:PASS
tts_adapter_init=Qwen3TtsAdapter:PASS
```

`qwen_tts` import also emitted two non-fatal runtime warnings: the system `sox` executable is not installed, and `flash-attn` is not installed. The package import and Jarvis isolated-environment gate still passed. No STT/TTS model smoke was run because it would require model download/load; no Qwen3.8 27B or Gemma model was loaded.

## Remaining UNIT 5 proofs at `ebd1c94`

Measured on 2026-09-20 KST from `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot` at HEAD `ebd1c94e8b298ba93caaf6e9734d19f8c85963bb` on `codex/jarvis-tauri-local-ai-20260920`.

### Isolated STT/TTS model smoke

All probes used `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/.venv-voice/bin/python` with `OPENKAKAO_VOICE_ENV=1`. Model cache paths were confined to `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/.venv-voice/cache`; Extra pid 20042's UV Python 3.11 environment was not used.

Real STT adapter smoke: **PASS**. `MlxWhisperAdapter(model="mlx-community/whisper-tiny-mlx")` transcribed 0.25 seconds of 16 kHz PCM silence and returned the expected empty transcript (`STT_SMOKE_PASS ''`). The model files were fetched into the isolated voice cache.

Real TTS adapter smoke: **FAIL before model load**. `Qwen3TtsAdapter()._load()` raised:

```text
ImportError: cannot import name 'Qwen3TTS' from 'qwen_tts' (.../.venv-voice/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qwen_tts/__init__.py)
```

The installed `qwen-tts==0.1.1` exports `Qwen3TTSModel`, while `scripts/jarvis_voice.py` imports `Qwen3TTS`. The already-known missing-SoX warning also appeared, but it is not the pass/fail criterion and the adapter failed independently on the API mismatch. No TTS model weights were loaded.

Follow-up: `Qwen3TtsAdapter` now imports `Qwen3TTSModel` and calls `generate_custom_voice`. Unit 3 covers the API mapping with a fake engine. A live 1.7B weight smoke was not run.

### Local Tauri debug artifact

`./node_modules/.bin/tauri build --debug` completed successfully without installing the app. The artifacts remain under `desktop/src-tauri/target`:

- `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/desktop/src-tauri/target/debug/openkakao-jarvis-desktop`
- `/Users/twoimo/Documents/projects/openkakao-bot/desktop/src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/macos/OpenKakao Jarvis.app`

The debug executable was not running after the build. Extra pid `20042` still resolved to `/Applications/AutoReplyMenu.app/Contents/MacOS/AutoReplyMenu`. The installed Extra and the debug Tauri bundle both report `CFBundleIdentifier=com.openkakao.auto-reply.menu`; this identifier collision is recorded as a cutover blocker. No codesign, replacement, launch, restart, or `/Applications/AutoReplyMenu.app` mutation was performed.

### style.gallery retry

`https://style.gallery/` returned **HTTP 200**. Read-only inspection extracted these restrained tokens: `--paper:#f6f5f0`, `--ink:#2c302b`, and the UI font stack `"Pretendard", "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Noto Sans KR", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`.

The paper/ink colors were not adopted because the existing oh-my-design palette already has the required warmer ivory/warm-black values and champagne-gold accent. The non-color font token fit the contract without neon, bloom, glow, or palette drift, so it was applied in `desktop/src/styles.css` as `--font-ui` and used for the root font family.

### Guardrail readback

- Extra pid `20042` remained the installed Swift Extra process.
- No process matching Qwen3.8 27B or Gemma was observed, and neither model was loaded by these probes.
- No Kakao send or live AX send was performed.
- Nothing was copied or installed into `/Applications/AutoReplyMenu.app`.
- No command used `/Users/twoimo/.codex/worktrees/5a1c/openkakao-bot` as its working directory and no file there was written.
- No git commit or push was performed.
